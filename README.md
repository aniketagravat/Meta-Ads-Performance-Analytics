📈 Project Overview

This project automates data ingestion and reporting for ad campaigns on Meta (Facebook & Instagram). It builds a full analytics pipeline — from raw campaign data retrieval via Meta Marketing API → data cleaning/ETL → to insightful dashboards in Power BI. The goal: convert ad-spend and engagement data into actionable marketing insights and ROI-driven decisions.

🔧 What It Does / What You Can Learn

Uses automatic API integration to fetch ad metrics (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue, CTR, CPC, etc.) on a recurring basis.

Cleans and transforms raw data using ETL/pre-processing steps (via Power Query), handling nulls/invalid entries, standardizing schema, and enabling dynamic filtering.

📊 Key Business Questions Answered

Which campaigns deliver the best return on ad spend (ROAS)?

Where is marketing budget being wasted — i.e. overspending with low conversions?

How do impressions, clicks, spend and conversions trend over time (daily/weekly)?

Which ad sets or creatives should be scaled vs. paused based on performance metrics?

Provide stakeholders with real-time campaign insights rather than post-mortem static reports.
